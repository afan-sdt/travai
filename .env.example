# Backend API Configuration
# This is your FastAPI backend URL that handles token generation
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For production, use your deployed backend URL:
# BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
# BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.render.com

# Note: LIVEKIT_API_KEY and LIVEKIT_API_SECRET should ONLY be in your backend,
# never in the mobile app for security reasons
